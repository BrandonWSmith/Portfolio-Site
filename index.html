      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="./resources/images/bio-image.jpg" alt="Brandon Smith">
      <p><strong>Programmer, Gamer, Musician.</strong><br><br>Born and raised in Louisville, KY, Brandon has always been intrigued with how things work. This intrest led Brandon to learn little bits of HTML at the early age of 13, back in the days of customizing MySpace pages. Brandon spent his teen years developing his skills on guitar and bass and went on to study Music Technology at Bellarmine University were he took a class in web design, greatly increasing his knowledge of HTML and CSS. Originally drawn to a career in music, Brandon eventually decided to take on more reliable work for a steady paycheck while still practicing, writing and recording music as a hobby which he continues to do today. From 2016 to 2023, Brandon rose through the ranks at Guitar Center, starting as a part-time Operations Associate and working all the way up to Store Manager. In 2023, Brandon decided it was time for a change and started taking courses on Codecademy.com to become a Front-End Engineer. Brandon hopes this career change will help him increase his knowledge of programming languages so he can better learn to build video games and eventually break into the Game Development industry.</p>

              <h4>Design System</h4>
              <p>The goal of this project was to create a site from scratch detailing the style properties of a non-existent website to demonstrate the use of HTML and CSS together.</p>

              <h4>Tea Cozy</h4>
              <p>The goal of this project was to create a site for a fictional tea company from a design spec to demonstrate the use of flex containers. I was provided with images for the site and created the neccesary HTML and CSS files to recreate the design spec as a funtional website.</p>

              <h4>Fotomatic</h4>
              <p>The goal of this project was to take an existing site that didn't scale to the size of the user's display and make it responsive using media queries. I was provided with a design spec of how the site should look on various screen sizes as well as the existing HTML, CSS and assets which I edited to make the site match the design spec for each screen size.</p>

              <h4>Credit Card Checker</h4>
              <p>The goal of this project was to create a JavaScript file that could check the validity of a set of credit card numbers to demonstrate the use of JavaScript arrays, loops and iterators. I was provided with arrays of 5 card numbers that were known to be valid, 5 card numbers that were known to be invalid and 5 card numbers which the validity was unknown and I created functions to check the validity of the cards using the Luhn algorithm and to check the issuer of each card. (This project is not a website but a functional JavaScript file)</p>

              <h4>Mysterious Organism</h4>
              <p>The goal of this project was to create a JavaScript file that could produce objects that simulate the DNA of a fictional organism to demonstrate the use of JavaScript arrays, loops, objects and iterators. I was provided with a function that would output random arrays of "DNA" and I created functions that would assign these arrays to new objects, simulate "DNA mutation" and create an array of "specimen" that would likely survive if their DNA had a certain percentage of a specific set of DNA bases.
