      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p><strong>Programmer, Gamer, Musician.</strong><br><br>Born and raised in Louisville, KY, Brandon has always been intrigued with how things work. This intrest led Brandon to learn little bits of HTML at the early age of 13, back in the days of customizing MySpace pages. Brandon spent his teen years developing his skills on guitar and bass and went on to study Music Technology at Bellarmine University were he took a class in web design, greatly increasing his knowledge of HTML and CSS. Originally drawn to a career in music, Brandon eventually decided to take on more reliable work for a steady paycheck while still practicing, writing and recording music as a hobby which he continues to do today. From 2016 to 2023, Brandon rose through the ranks at Guitar Center, starting as a part-time Operations Associate and working all the way up to Store Manager. In 2023, Brandon decided it was time for a change and started taking courses on Codecademy.com to become a Front-End Engineer. Brandon hopes this career change will help him increase his knowledge of programming languages so he can better learn to build video games and eventually break into the Game Development industry.</p>
